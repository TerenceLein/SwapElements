	SwapElements
	A simple Code Eval challenge.
	An input file where each line contains a set of integers followed by 
	a set of swap instructions. A swap instruction refers to the integer set as
	a zero based list of elements.
	{i0, i1, i2, ...} : {e1-e2, e3-e4, ...}
	The swap is performed in place unless both elements are the same in which case no
	swap is needed.
	The newly ordered list is printed.
	
	This is a demonstration c++ project showing parsing, the use of containers, stream io.
